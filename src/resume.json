    "summary": "I have developed applications that act on a realtime manner involving continuously incoming data streams. I also have experience designing and setting up a fault tolerant, distributed, and secure infrastructure. I have done development workflows redesign ie integrating CI/CD and containerization as well. I can work on data analytics particularly with natural language processing and audio data processing. I can also setup database warehouse systems to store large data and make it so that data retrieval speeds are relatively fast provided I have access to the application code as well.",
